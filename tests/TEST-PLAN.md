# Capacity Planner - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Document Purpose
This test plan serves as the definitive guide for regression testing across all project phases. It documents testing strategies, procedures, and standards to ensure consistent quality and user satisfaction as the project evolves.

## Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: All code is written tests-first using Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Human-Centered Design**: User testing validates that we're solving real problems effectively
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every feature includes technical and user validation
- **Regression Safety**: All tests are documented and repeatable for future releases
- **Quality Gates**: No code ships without passing all test tiers

## 4-Tier Testing Architecture

### **Tier 1: Unit Tests** (Developer Testing)
**Purpose**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/`
- **Framework**: Vitest
- **Execution**: `npm test`
- **Coverage Target**: 100% of business logic, data models, utility functions
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock all external dependencies (database, APIs, file system)

**Standards**:
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

### **Tier 2: Integration Tests** (System Testing)
**Purpose**: Test component interactions and API endpoints
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Framework**: Vitest + Supertest
- **Execution**: `npm run test:integration`
- **Coverage**: HTTP routes, middleware, database operations, static file serving
- **Environment**: Uses test database with isolated test data

**Standards**:
- Test complete request/response cycles
- Verify database state changes
- Test authentication and authorization
- Include error handling scenarios
- Clean up test data after each test

### **Tier 3: Functional Tests** (Technical Testing)
**Purpose**: Manual end-to-end testing of complete technical workflows
- **Location**: `tests/functional/`
- **Format**: Structured markdown checklists
- **Execution**: Manual testing following documented procedures
- **Coverage**: Complete technical journeys, UI/UX validation, cross-browser testing

**Standards**:
- Step-by-step instructions with expected outcomes
- Screenshots for visual validation
- Browser compatibility requirements
- Accessibility testing checkpoints
- Performance benchmarks where applicable

### **Tier 4: User Testing** (Human-Centered Testing)
**Purpose**: Validate that real users can accomplish their goals effectively
- **Location**: `tests/user-testing/`
- **Participants**: Target users, stakeholders, domain experts
- **Format**: Structured scenarios, observation notes, feedback collection
- **Coverage**: Usability, user acceptance, business value validation

**Components**:
- **Usability Testing**: Task-based testing with real users
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Stakeholder validation of business requirements
- **Feedback Integration**: Systematic collection and prioritization of user insights
