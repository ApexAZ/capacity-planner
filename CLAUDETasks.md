- Complete end-to-end capacity planning workflow

**Quality Metrics Achieved**:
- 317 tests passing with 100% reliability
- 0 ESLint errors/warnings with strict TypeScript compilation
- Comprehensive test coverage across all architectural layers
- Security audit completed with A+ rating
- Rate limiting implemented for all authentication endpoints

---

## Development Approach

### Vertical Slice Development Standards (INVEST)

#### INVEST Criteria for All Feature Development
- **Independent**: Each slice should be self-contained and not dependent on other unfinished slices
- **Negotiable**: Scope can be adjusted based on learning and feedback during implementation
- **Valuable**: Each slice delivers working functionality that users can actually test and interact with
- **Estimable**: Slice scope should be small enough to complete and test within a reasonable timeframe
- **Small**: Keep slices minimal - focus on core functionality, avoid feature creep
- **Testable**: Each slice must include both automated tests and manual functional testing

#### Vertical Slice Structure Requirements
- **Full Stack**: Every slice must include database ÔøΩ API ÔøΩ frontend ÔøΩ tests
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Users should be able to complete a real workflow through the web interface
- **Immediate Feedback**: Each slice should be demonstrable and testable upon completion
- **Iterative Validation**: Validate assumptions and gather feedback before building the next slice
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each slice builds upon previous functionality without breaking existing features

### Project Lifecycle Preferences
- **Planning approach**: Vertical slices following INVEST principles for immediate testability
- **Refactor vs rebuild decisions**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Technical debt handling**: TBD (to be examined)

## Learning & Development Focus

### Current Focus Areas
- **Project focus**: Web development fundamentals with capacity planning tool
- **Skills to develop**: TBD (temporary - learning options)

### Areas for Future Definition
- **Preferred session lengths**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Break reminders/focus techniques**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Context switching approach**: TBD (to be examined)

### Security & Safety
- [ ] **Sensitive data handling**: TBD (to be examined)
- [ ] **Code safety checks**: TBD (to be examined)

### Maintenance & Operations
- [ ] **Dependency update approach**: TBD (to be examined - conservative vs aggressive)
- [ ] **Code cleanup frequency**: TBD (to be examined)
- [ ] **Tool update preferences**: TBD (to be examined - auto vs manual)

### Error Recovery & Backup
- [ ] **Backup strategies**: TBD (to be examined)
- [ ] **Rollback preferences**: TBD (to be examined - git revert vs manual fixes)
- [ ] **Solution documentation**: TBD (to be examined)
