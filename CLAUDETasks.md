## Current Work: ESLint Compliance Improvement (2025-06-28)

### Progress Summary
**Systematic ESLint error reduction project in progress:**
- **36% reduction** in total ESLint problems: **684 → 438** issues  
- **33% reduction** in ESLint errors: **488 → 327** errors
- **43% reduction** in ESLint warnings: **196 → 111** warnings

### Files Made Fully ESLint Compliant (11 files)
1. ✅ `src/__tests__/helpers/assertion-helpers.ts` - Complete refactor with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. ✅ `src/__tests__/api/calendar-entries.test.ts` - Fixed unsafe member access with type casting  
3. ✅ `src/__tests__/api/users.test.ts` - Fixed Express middleware types and response types
4. ✅ `src/__tests__/frontend/teams-dom-safety.test.ts` - Fixed unbound method references
5. ✅ `src/__tests__/frontend/teams-type-safety.test.ts` - Fixed nullish coalescing and unused variables
6. ✅ `src/__tests__/frontend/calendar.test.ts` - Fixed curly braces and nullish coalescing
7. ✅ `src/__tests__/helpers/test-data-factory.ts` - Added missing return type
8. ✅ `src/__tests__/integration/i-logout.test.ts` - Fixed unsafe assignments with proper types
9. ✅ `src/__tests__/integration/server-static-files.test.ts` - Added missing return type
10. ✅ `src/__tests__/middleware/rate-limiter.test.ts` - Fixed API response type assertions
11. ✅ `scripts/ensure-static-files.ts` - Added appropriate ESLint disable for console logs

### Files with Significant Error Reduction
- `src/__tests__/helpers/mock-setup-helpers.ts` - Reduced from 3 critical errors to 0 errors (only warnings remain)

### Next Session Tasks
**Continue systematic ESLint error reduction:**
1. **Integration test files** - Focus on unsafe assignment/member access patterns
   - `src/__tests__/integration/i-session-authentication.test.ts` (28 errors)
   - `src/__tests__/integration/i-protected-*.test.ts` files
   - `src/__tests__/integration/calendar-workflow.test.ts`

2. **Model test files** - Complex mocking patterns need type safety
   - `src/__tests__/models/u-Session.test.ts` (46 errors) 
   - `src/__tests__/models/u-User.test.ts`
   - `src/__tests__/models/Team.test.ts`
   - `src/__tests__/models/CalendarEntry.test.ts`

3. **Remaining helper files** - Return types and type safety
   - `src/__tests__/helpers/mock-setup-helpers.ts` (13 warnings remaining)

### ESLint Error Patterns Being Addressed
- **Unsafe assignment/member access** - Adding proper type assertions and interfaces
- **Missing return types** - Adding explicit return types to all functions
- **Explicit `any` types** - Replacing with proper TypeScript interfaces  
- **Non-null assertions** - Using safe null checking patterns
- **Unbound method references** - Using proper binding or arrow functions

### Strategy
Systematic file-by-file approach targeting critical errors first, then warnings. Focus on establishing consistent type-safe patterns that can be applied across remaining files.

## Development Approach

### Vertical Slice Development Standards (INVEST)

#### INVEST Criteria for All Feature Development
- **Independent**: Each slice should be self-contained and not dependent on other unfinished slices
- **Negotiable**: Scope can be adjusted based on learning and feedback during implementation
- **Valuable**: Each slice delivers working functionality that users can actually test and interact with
- **Estimable**: Slice scope should be small enough to complete and test within a reasonable timeframe
- **Small**: Keep slices minimal - focus on core functionality, avoid feature creep
- **Testable**: Each slice must include both automated tests and manual functional testing

#### Vertical Slice Structure Requirements
- **Full Stack**: Every slice must include database � API � frontend � tests
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Users should be able to complete a real workflow through the web interface
- **Immediate Feedback**: Each slice should be demonstrable and testable upon completion
- **Iterative Validation**: Validate assumptions and gather feedback before building the next slice
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each slice builds upon previous functionality without breaking existing features

### Project Lifecycle Preferences
- **Planning approach**: Vertical slices following INVEST principles for immediate testability
- **Refactor vs rebuild decisions**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Technical debt handling**: TBD (to be examined)
