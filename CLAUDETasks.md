## Project Phases & Roadmap

### Current Phase: MVP
Basic team management, calendar system, and capacity calculation

### Next Phase: Advanced Features
- React migration for improved UI/UX
- Multi-team support and coordination
- Azure deployment for production hosting

---

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Vertical Slices 
1. **Working Days Calculator** - Comprehensive business logic with full test coverage
2. **Team Management** - Full CRUD operations and UI with 142 tests
3. **Calendar Entry Management** - PTO/holiday tracking with complete integration

### Next Priority: Sprint Capacity Dashboard =�
**Objectives**:
- Auto-generate sprints based on team configuration
- Real-time capacity visualization with team availability
- Complete end-to-end capacity planning workflow

**Quality Metrics Achieved**:
- All tests passing with 100% reliability
- 0 ESLint errors/warnings with strict TypeScript compilation
- Comprehensive test coverage across all architectural layers

## Development Approach

### Vertical Slice Development Standards (INVEST)

#### INVEST Criteria for All Feature Development
- **Independent**: Each slice should be self-contained and not dependent on other unfinished slices
- **Negotiable**: Scope can be adjusted based on learning and feedback during implementation
- **Valuable**: Each slice delivers working functionality that users can actually test and interact with
- **Estimable**: Slice scope should be small enough to complete and test within a reasonable timeframe
- **Small**: Keep slices minimal - focus on core functionality, avoid feature creep
- **Testable**: Each slice must include both automated tests and manual functional testing

#### Vertical Slice Structure Requirements
- **Full Stack**: Every slice must include database � API � frontend � tests
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Users should be able to complete a real workflow through the web interface
- **Immediate Feedback**: Each slice should be demonstrable and testable upon completion
- **Iterative Validation**: Validate assumptions and gather feedback before building the next slice
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each slice builds upon previous functionality without breaking existing features

### Project Lifecycle Preferences
- **Planning approach**: Vertical slices following INVEST principles for immediate testability
- **Refactor vs rebuild decisions**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Technical debt handling**: TBD (to be examined)

## Learning & Development Focus

### Current Focus Areas
- **Project focus**: Web development fundamentals with capacity planning tool
- **Skills to develop**: TBD (temporary - learning options)

### Areas for Future Definition
- **Preferred session lengths**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Break reminders/focus techniques**: TBD (to be examined)
- **Context switching approach**: TBD (to be examined)

## Future Planning Items (TBD)

### Code Quality & Development Preferences
- [ ] **Line length limit**: TBD (temporary - learning options)
- [ ] **Learning approach**: TBD (to be examined - theory first vs hands-on first)
- [ ] **Problem-solving limits**: TBD (to be examined - research time, when to ask for help)
- [ ] **Tool stability preference**: TBD (to be examined - stable vs bleeding-edge)

### Security & Safety
- [ ] **Sensitive data handling**: TBD (to be examined)
- [ ] **Code safety checks**: TBD (to be examined)

### Maintenance & Operations
- [ ] **Dependency update approach**: TBD (to be examined - conservative vs aggressive)
- [ ] **Code cleanup frequency**: TBD (to be examined)
- [ ] **Tool update preferences**: TBD (to be examined - auto vs manual)

### Error Recovery & Backup
- [ ] **Backup strategies**: TBD (to be examined)
- [ ] **Rollback preferences**: TBD (to be examined - git revert vs manual fixes)
- [ ] **Solution documentation**: TBD (to be examined)

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Priorities (Sprint Capacity Dashboard)
1. **TDD Implementation** (MANDATORY):
   - Write tests FIRST for sprint generation logic
   - Implement auto-generation of sprints based on team configuration
   - Create sprint planning interface with capacity visualization
   - Build complete end-to-end capacity planning workflow

### Future Enhancements
2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Add proper date validation (Invalid Date handling)
   - Implement conflict checking for calendar entries
   - Add rate limiting and security headers
   - Performance optimization and caching

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Azure deployment preparation
   - Multi-team support implementation
   - React migration planning and execution
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
